            <h3>The Rengstorff House</h3>
            <p>
            One of the oldest houses in the Bay Area, the 
            <a href="http://www.r-house.org/">Rengstorff House</a> is an Italianate mansion
            built by Henry Rengstorff, a prominent trader in the Bay Area and immigrant from Germany. 
            After staying in the family for several generations, the house fell into ruin before the 
            city of Mountain View bought and restored the house in the 1990s. While Joe lived in 
            Mountain View, he and Sin came here often on walks to see the house, the bay and the 
            beautiful wetlands nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our wedding will be outdoors in the gardens surrounding the Rengstorff House. 
            It can get chilly when the sun goes down, so you may want to bring a hat, 
            a wrap, or even a light scarf!

          <h2>When</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
            The wedding ceremony will be in the late afternoon, followed by a cocktail reception 
            and a light dinner. Exact times will be included in invitations and posted here nearer to the wedding date.

            <h3>If you're flying:</h3>
            <p>
            First of all, thanks for coming to be with us! The Bay Area has three major 
            airports. We recommend you fly to either 
            <a href="http://www.flysfo.com/">San Francisco</a> or 
            <a href="http://www.flysanjose.com/">San Jose International</a>, but 
            <a href="http://flyoakland.com">Oakland International</a> is also nearby. From 
            any of the airports it takes between 30 minutes and an hour to get to Mountain View. 
            San Jose is the closest, Oakland is the furthest away, and San Francisco has the most arrivals. 
            </p>

            <h3>If you're driving:</h3>
            Consider carpooling - there's limited parking in Shoreline Park near the house. 
            You can <a href="mailto:joe.blubaugh@gmail.com">email Joe</a> and he'll help 
            people who'd like to carpool coordinate rides. We'll also share shuttle bus information with you - 
            it may be easier to park at the hotels than for everyone to try and drive to the park.
            If you're planning to drive to Shoreline Park, please also <a href="mailto:joe.blubaugh@gmail.com">email Joe</a>. 
            We'll have a few parking permits for some special spaces in the park lots.
          </div>
          <h2>Accomodations</h2>
          <div class="content">
            We are blocking out rooms in two hotels in Mountain View and will provide details 
            for making reservations in early February. We'll also have some shuttle buses between
            the hotels and the Rengstorff House so you can feel free to enjoy your night with 
            us without worrying about making transportation arrangements.
